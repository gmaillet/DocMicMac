\chapter{Simplified Tools}

\label{Simp:Tool:One}


This chapter describes simplified tools that allow to make
computations without filling XML-files.
Of course they cannot deal with all the situation that are
handled by complex tools, but I hope that in near future they
will be sufficient for $95\%$ of usages.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{All in one command}


These tools are still in development but, I hope, the first complete version
will be available soon. However many tools already exist, what is ready now :



\begin{itemize}
    \item full automatic tie points computation works (see {\tt Tapioca} tool in~\ref{Tapioca});
    \item full automatic orientation computation works (see {\tt Tapas} tool in~\ref{Tapas});
    \item full automatic matching is not achieved,  there exist some piece  of
	  code that may be already useful for some users, see~\ref{FullAutoMatch};
    \item semi-automatic matching works with tool {\tt Malt}, see~\ref{SemiAutoMatch};
\end{itemize}

\section{Modification since Mercurial version}

\label{MERCURIAL}

Since end of $2012$, several modification on the general organization of the project occurred.
This section describes the main modification. Although much care were taken to guarantee a strict
compatibility with previous version, it is recommended to use the new mechanisms.


\subsection{Installing the tools}
\label{Install}

The main modification on the distribution are :

\begin{itemize}
   \item  the versionning tool is now {\tt mercurial}
   \item  the tools are working on {\tt Linux}, {\tt MacOs} and  {\tt Windows};
   \item  the tools are also distributed on binary version (however, it remains of course
	  an open source project and it is still possible to download the source code).
\end{itemize}

To get the binary version, go to : \url{http://logiciels.ign.fr/?Telechargement,20}


To get the source (you will need to install the mercurial versionning system) type :

\begin{verbatim}
 hg clone https://culture3d:culture3d@geoportail.forge.ign.fr/hg/culture3d
\end{verbatim}

To update source code, type:

\begin{verbatim}
 hg pull https://culture3d:culture3d@geoportail.forge.ign.fr/hg/culture3d
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
hg up https://culture3d:culture3d@geoportail.forge.ign.fr/hg/culture3d
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{The \emph{new universal} command {\tt mm3d}}

This section describe a significant modification that occurred since end of $2012$. To decrease the
size of binary version, and to facilitate and unify the development, the syntax for calling the tools is now
based on a unique command {\tt mm3d}. The general syntax is :

\begin{verbatim}
   mm3d Command arg1 arg2 ... argn  NameOpt1=Argot1 ...
\end{verbatim}

For example, a possible call to the {\tt Tapas} tool with the new syntax would be :

\begin{verbatim}
   mm3d Tapas  RadialStd ".*.PEF" Out=All
\end{verbatim}


For backward compatibility (support of existing user's script), the old syntax is still supported
for most of the existing tool. For example, it is still valid to write :

\begin{verbatim}
   Tapas  RadialStd ".*.PEF" Out=All
\end{verbatim}

However, it is recommended for new scripts to be based on the universal command {\tt mm3d}.



\subsection{Help with {\tt mm3d}}

When typing only {\tt mm3d}, user can get a list of existing commands :


\begin{verbatim}
 mm3d
mm3d : Allowed commands
 AperiCloud	 Visualization of camera in ply file
 Apero	 Compute external and internal orientations
 AperoChImSecMM	Select secondary images for MicMac
 Bascule	 Generate orientations coherent with some physical information on the scene
 BatchFDC	 Tool for batching a set of commands
 Campari	 Interface to Apero, for compensation of heterogeneous measures
 ChgSysCo	 Chang coordinate system of orientation
 CmpCalib	 Do some stuff
 cod	 Do some stuff
 CreateEpip	 Tool create epipolar images
 Dequant	 Tool for dequantifying an image
 Devlop	 Do some stuff
 ElDcraw	 Do some stuff
....
\end{verbatim}

If the first argument is not an existing command, some indication is given to help to find
the "good" name. For example, if one knows that command begin by {\tt ta}  :

\begin{verbatim}
 mm3d ta
Suggest by Prefix Match
    Tapas
    Tapioca
    Tarama
    Tawny
\end{verbatim}

On the other hand, if you type {\tt mm3d ascul} , as there is no command beginning by {\tt ascul},
one will get all the commands that contain {\tt ascul} :


\begin{verbatim}
mm3d ascu
Suggest by Subex Match
    Bascule
    GCPBascule
    CenterBascule
    NuageBascule
    RepLocBascule
    SBGlobBascule
\end{verbatim}


Finally if arg is nor a prefix nor a subexpression of any command, it will be tested as posix regular
expression :

\begin{verbatim}
mm3d .*C.*asc.*
Suggest by Pattern Match
    GCPBascule
    CenterBascule
    RepLocBascule
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Log files}

For the main command, a log file {\tt mm3d-LogFile.txt} is created, this file stores
a global history of all the processing. An example extracted from my dataset :

\begin{verbatim}

\section{Computing Tie Points with Tapioca}

{\tt Tapioca} is a simple tool interface for computing tie points.
I think {\tt Tapioca}  should be sufficient in $95\%$ of cases.
If it is not the case, you will have to refer to a more complex and powerful
tool named {\tt Pastis} which will be described later.
In fact, {\tt Tapioca} is only an interface to {\tt Pastis}
\footnote{{\tt Pastis}  being itself an interface to \SiftPP \dots}.

\label{Tapioca}

    % - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{General Structure}

If {\tt bin/Tapioca} does not exit, build it with {\tt make bin/Tapioca}.

The general syntax of {\tt Tapioca} is:

\begin{center}
   {\tt bin/Tapioca   Mode  Files  Arg1 Arg2  \dots Opt1=Val Opt2=Val \dots}
\end{center}

Here are possible \UNCLEAR{use} of {\tt Tapioca}:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
bin/Tapioca All  "../micmac_data/ExempleDoc/Boudha/IMG_[0-9]{4}.tif" -1  ExpTxt=1
bin/Tapioca Line  "../micmac_data/ExempleDoc/Boudha/IMG_[0-9]{4}.tif" -1   3 ExpTxt=1
bin/Tapioca MulScale "../micmac_data/ExempleDoc/Boudha/IMG_[0-9]{4}.tif" 300 -1 ExpTxt=1
bin/Tapioca File  "../micmac_data/ExempleDoc/Boudha/MesCouples.xml" -1  ExpTxt=1
\end{verbatim}
}


The meaning of arguments is:

\begin{itemize}

    \item {\tt Mode} is an enumerated value specifying a functioning mode
	  (i.e. a way to compute the pair of images that are to be matched).
	  These values are {\tt All} for all possible pairs, {\tt MulScale}
	  for a multi-scale optimization, {\tt Line} for a selection adapted
	  to linear images acquisition, and {\tt File} for  XML file
	  describing the pairs;

    \item {\tt Files} specifies a set of images to be matched. For all these
	 images, a set of sift descriptor will be computed. However, all the pairs of
	 descriptors sets will not be  matched. To optimize the computation, a subset
	 of \UNCLEAR{images pair} will be described by the {\tt Mode} parameters.
	 The first part of {\tt Files} is a directory, and the second one is the description
	 of the files to be computed with Tapioca.
	 The results will be written in the subdirectory {\tt Homol} of the
	 specified directory as it was described in~\ref{Tie:Poi:Ex:Apero};



    \item  {\tt Arg1 Arg2  \dots} are mandatory parameters; their number depends
	   upon {\tt Mode}, it always includes a resolution parameter;

    \item  {\tt  Opt1=Val Opt2=Val  \dots} are optional parameters. The possible
	   optional parameters depends upon {\tt Mode}.
	   There is always at least two possible optional parameters:

	    \begin{itemize}
		 \item {\tt ExpTxt} indicates if you want an export in text mode;
		       default is $0$ (binary mode);

		 \item {\tt ByP} indicates the number of processors that will be used
			to \UNCLEAR{parallelize the process}; %simultaneously
		       default is the number of
			processors described in~\ref{Mic:File:Config}.
	    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

If you do not remember the possible mode key words, just type:

\begin{center}
	{\tt bin/Tapioca}
\end{center}

The possible values will be printed.

If you do not remember the argument
corresponding to a possible mode, just type {\tt bin/Tapioca mode -help},
for example:

\begin{center}
	{\tt bin/Tapioca MulScale -help}
\end{center}



    % - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{Computing All the Tie Points of a Set of Images}

The simplest case of use of {\tt Tapioca} is when you only want to compute tie points
between all the pairs of a set of images. The syntax is:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
    bin/Tapioca All  Files  Size  ArgOpt=
\end{verbatim}
}

The only optional arguments are those common to all modes ({\tt ExpTxt}  and {\tt ByP}).

The parameter {\tt Files} is the concatenation of the directory where the files
are located with a regular expression used as a filter on the existing files
of the directory.

The parameter {\tt Size} is used to shrink the images. It does not specify
a scale but the desired width for shrinking the images. For example, if the initial
image has a width of $5000$, and the value is $2000$, it will specify
a scaling of $0.4$. If its value is $-1$, it means, conventionally, no shrinking.
This is the value chosen in the examples, in order  to limit the size of the transmitted
data, the images have already been shrunk. With real images, I do not
recommend the value $-1$ but rather a value corresponding to a scaling
between $0.3$ and $0.5$.


The example:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
    bin/Tapioca All  "../micmac_data/ExempleDoc/Boudha/IMG_[0-9]{4}.tif" -1  ExpTxt=1
\end{verbatim}
}

It generates tie points computation between all the pairs of images of the {\tt Boudha} directory,
with names matching {\tt IMG\_[0-9]{4}.tif}. There is no shrinking, the export is
made in text mode.

    % - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{Optimization for Linear Canvas}

It often occurs that the photos canvas  has a linear structure, for example, when you acquire
photos of a facade walking  along the street.   In this case, you
know that $K^{th}$  can only have tie points
with images in the interval $[K-\delta,K+\delta]$; giving this information
to Tapioca can save a lot of time. The syntax is:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
    bin/Tapioca Line  Files  Size  delta ArgOpt=
\end{verbatim}
}

{\tt delta} is $\delta$ and all the other arguments have the same meaning as in the
 {\tt All} mode.

    % - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{Multi Scale Approach}


The mode  {\tt MulScale} can save  significant computation time on large sets of images.
Even if it is not optimal for all canvas, it has the benefit of being general
and usable with any data set.

In this mode, a first computation of tie points is made for all the pairs
of images at very low resolution (so it is quite fast).Then the
computation, at the desired resolution, is done  only for the pairs
having, at low resolution, a number  of tie points exceeding a given
threshold.



{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
     bin/Tapioca MulScale Files  SizeLow Size  NbMinPt=   ArgOpt=
\end{verbatim}
}

{\tt SizeLow} is the size of the images that will be used at low resolution.
{\tt Size} is the targeted size.  The optional value {\tt NbMinPt}
is the threshold on the number of tie points detected at low resolution,
its default value is $2$. For example:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
    bin/Tapioca MulScale "../micmac_data/ExempleDoc/Boudha/IMG_[0-9]{4}.tif" 300 -1 ExpTxt=1
\end{verbatim}
}

Computes  tie points with images of width of $300$, and if the pairs have at least
$2$ tie points, it does the computation at full resolution.


    % - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{Explicit Specification of images pairs} %of the Pairs of Images

Sometimes, you will have external information (like embedded GPS) that allows
you to know which pairs of images are potential candidates for tie points.
If you are familiar with computer programming, you will find that
the easiest way to communicate your information is to write a file
containing the explicit list of pairs of images.
It is possible in the {\tt File} mode, the file containing
the pairs must have the following structure:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<SauvegardeNamedRel>
     <Cple>IMG_5564.tif IMG_5565.tif</Cple>
     <Cple>IMG_5574.tif IMG_5575.tif</Cple>
     <Cple>IMG_5580.tif IMG_5579.tif</Cple>
     <Cple>IMG_5581.tif IMG_5582.tif</Cple>
</SauvegardeNamedRel>
\end{verbatim}
}

The syntax is:


{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
    bin/Tapioca File  NameOfFile  Size   ArgOpt=
\end{verbatim}
}

The pairs contained in the file {\tt NameOfFile} are names relative
to the directory indicated by the first part of {\tt NameOfFile}.
For example in:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
bin/Tapioca File  "../micmac_data/ExempleDoc/Boudha/MesCouples.xml" -1  ExpTxt=1
\end{verbatim}
}


In the pair {\tt <Cple>IMG\_5564.tif IMG\_5565.tif</Cple>}, the first name means
\newline
{\tt "../micmac\_data/ExempleDoc/Boudha/IMG\_5564.tif}.




\subsection{The tool {\tt GrapheHom}}

A tool for generating a file image pairs, as input to {\tt Tapioca File \dots } from external Data (GPS or GPS-INS).

\begin{verbatim}
GrapheHom  -help

\end{verbatim}

The three first mandatory args :

\end{itemize}


The optional args :

\begin{itemize}

\section{Simple relative orientation and calibration with Tapas}

\label{Tapas}

     % - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - -

\subsection{Generalities}

The general tool for computing orientation of images is {\tt Apero},
this is a relatively complex tool an overview of which is given in chapter~\ref{Intro:QuickApero}.
These sections describe a set of basic tools offering a simplified interface
to some of the elementary functionalities of {\tt Apero} :

\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt Tapas}, in this section, is a tool offering most of the possibilities
	 of {\tt Apero} for computing purely relative orientations;

   \item {\tt AperiCloud}, in~\ref{APERICLOUD} for generating a visualization of camera
	 position and sparse $3D$ model;

   \item {\tt Campari}, in~\ref{CAMPARI} is a tool for compensation of heterogeneous measures (tie points and ground control points);

   \item {\tt Bascule}, in~\ref{BASCULE}, for generating orientations coherent with
	some physical information on the scene;

   \item {\tt MakeGrid}, in~\ref{MAKEGRID}, for generating   orientations  in a grid
	 format that is more adapted to some further processing;

\end{itemize}

Like with many tools, one can type {\tt Tapas -help} to a have a brieve description
of {\tt Tapas}'s argument.

The directory {\tt MurSaintMartin/} in {\tt micmac\_data/ExempleDoc/}, contains
a first set of data, that will be used for illustrating {\tt Tapas}.
This set is made of $23$ jpeg images that have been acquired with the same
camera and same focal length; it is made of two subset :

\begin{itemize}
    \item $17$ images of a wall : images {\tt IMGP4167.JPG} to {\tt IMGP4183.JPG}, the first
	  $8$ images are presented on figure~\ref{FIG:StM:Mur};
    \item $6$ images of a corner, that can be optionnally used for intrinsic calibration
	   : images {\tt IMGP4160.JPG} to {\tt IMGP4165.JPG}, the images are on figure~\ref{FIG:StM:Calib} ;

To run the example using {\tt Tapas}, tie points will be required, they can
be computed by the two  commands \footnote{the command used in this example can be found in
the file {\tt ExCmd.txt}} :


\begin{verbatim}
Tapioca All "IMGP416[0-5].JPG" 1000

\subsection{Basic usage}


\label{Basi:Tapas}

	%  -    -    -    -    -    -    -     -
\subsubsection{Syntax}

The basic command to run  {\tt Tapas} is :

\begin{center}
   {\tt Tapas  ModeCalib  PatternImage}
\end{center}

Where :

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt ModeCalib} is an enumerated value specifying a model
	  of calibration;
    \item {\tt PatternImage} is a pattern specifying the subset of images
	  to orientate;
\end{itemize}

For example the command :


\begin{verbatim}
Tapas RadialExtended "IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG"
\end{verbatim}

Means :


\begin{itemize}
   \item compute the relative orientation of the set of images defined by the regular
	 expression ;

   \item for the intrinsic calibration use a model {\tt RadialExtended};

    \item there is exactly one intrinsic calibration unknown for each focal length, the focal
	  length being extracted from exif metadata; the exif meta-data is used for
	  defining the  initial value of each

    \item  use a predefined strategy for computing orientations and intrinsic calibration.

\end{itemize}

	%  -    -    -    -    -    -    -     -

\subsubsection{Distorsion models}
\label{Tap:Dis:Mod}

The possible value of  {\tt ModeCalib} are :


\begin{itemize}

   \item {\tt \bf RadialExtended} a model with radial distortion
	 (as specified in~\ref{SpGeo:Rad});
	 in this model there are $10$ degrees of freedom:
	 $1$ for focal length  , $2$ for principal point, $2$ for distorsion center ,
	 $5$ for coefficients of radial distortion ($r^3$, $r^5$ \dots $r^{11}$);

   \item {\tt \bf RadialBasic}  a "subset" of previous model:
	  radial distortion with limited degrees of freedom ;
	 adapted when there is a risk of divergence of {\tt RadialExtended};
	 in this model there are $5$ degrees of freedom :  $1$ for focal length  ,
	 $2$ for principal point and distortion center \footnote{they are constrained to have
	 the same value} ,
	 $2$ for coefficients of radial distortion ($r^3$ and  $r^5$);



   \item {\tt \bf Fraser}  a radial model, with decentric and affine parameters
	  (as specified in~\ref{SpGeo:Fraser}); there are $12$ degrees of freedom:
	 $1$ for focal length  , $2$ for principal point, $2$ for distortion center ,
	 $3$ for coefficients of radial distorsion ($r^3$, $r^5$  $r^7$),
	 $2$ for decentric parameters, $2$ for affine parameters;
	 the optional parameters {\tt LibAff} and {\tt LibDec} (def value true) can
	 be set to false if decentric of affine parameters must stay frozen;


   \item {\tt \bf FraserBasic}  same as previous with for principal point and distortion center
	 constrained to have the same value (so $10$ degree of freedom);

   \item {\tt \bf FishEyeEqui}  a model adapted for diagonal fisheyes equilinear
	 ( with $atan$ physicall model completed with polynomial parameters,
	  as specified in~\ref{SpGeo:FishEye}); there are $14$ degrees of freedom:
	 $1$ for focal length  , $2$ for principal point, $2$ for distorsion center ,
	 $5$ for coefficients of radial distortion ($r^3$, $r^5$  $r^7$),
	 $2$ for decentric parameters, $2$ for affine parameters;
	 by default the ray defining the useful mask, see~\ref{SpGep:RU}
	 is $95\%$ of the diagonal;


   \item {\tt \bf HemiEqui}  same model as previous, but  by default the ray defining
	 the useful mask, see~\ref{SpGep:RU} is $52\%$ of the diagonal; adapted
	 to hemispheric equilinear fisheye;


   \item {\tt \bf AutoCal} and {\tt \bf Figee} , with this tag no model is defined,
	 all the calibration must have a value (via {\tt InCal} or {\tt InOri} options);
	 with {\tt  AutoCal} the calibration are re-evaluated while with {\tt  Figee}
	 it stay frozen.

\end{itemize}


For all the mode, except of course {\bf AutoCal} and {\tt Figee},  the initial
value of intrinsic calibration is computed this way :

\begin{itemize}
   \item focal length is computed from exif data using the rules described in~\ref{CamDB};

   \item principal point and, when apply, distortion center are  at the middle
	 of image (except when using the {\tt Decentre} option);

   \item initial distortion is equal to the physical ideal model :   null for the
	 standard lenses and equal to $atant$ for  fisheye;

\end{itemize}

With {\tt Tapas}, the user has very few control on the  strategy used to compute
orientation.  The predefined strategy used by {\tt Tapas} is :

\begin{itemize}
   \item initialize all the intrinsic calibration using exif data (or already c
	 computed calibration provided by existing files), then freeze all these unknown;

   \item choose a central images (the image that has the maximum of tie points);

   \item compute the orientation of images with the "standard" strategy described
	  in~\ref{Apero:Ordering};


   \item once all the image are ordered, free in a predefined order all the intrinsic
	 parameters;

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Results}

The result of {\tt Tapas} are stored in a subdirectory {\tt Ori-OUTDIR} ,
where {\tt OUTDIR} is specified by the optional {\tt out} argument of {\tt Tapas},
when {\tt out} is not specified the value of {\tt ModeCalib} is used.
With this basic command, the result are stored in the directory {\tt Ori-RadialExtended/} :



\begin{itemize}
   \item the file {\tt AutoCal280.xml} contains the intrinsic calibration; the name
	 has been automatically computed from the focal length got in exif file (here $28 mm$);
	 there is only one file because there was only one focal length;

   \item   the  files {\tt Orientation-IMGPXXXX.JPG.xml} contain the external orientations;

   \item  the detailed specification of intrinsic calibration and external orientation can
	  be found in~\ref{Chap:GeoLoc}, by the way it's not necessary to have a full
	  understanding of this format for using it in {\tt MicMac} and  other tools .
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Successive calls to Tapas}

\label{Succ:Call:Tapas}

Even with simple acquisition, where all the images have been acquired with
the same lenses, the usage of {\tt Tapas} presented in~\ref{Basi:Tapas} may
be too basic.  The risk is that, starting from a very rough estimation from the
intrinsic calibration, the  computation of orientation do not converge to a
good solution.
With large data set, it is often preferable to proceed in two step :

\begin{itemize}
   \item  compute on a small set of image a value of intrinsic calibration,
	  this set of image should be favorable to calibration; ideally,
	  it should fulfill the following requirements :

\begin{itemize}
  \item  all image converging  to same part of the scene,to facilitate the computation
	 of external  orientation

   \item  a scene with sufficient depth variation ,to have accurate focal length estimation;

   \item  a image acquisition where there position of the same ground points are located at
	  very different position in the different images where they are seen, this is to
	  have accurate estimation of distortion; this can be obtained by rotating the camera
	  like acquisition of figure~\ref{FIG:StM:Calib};

\end{itemize}
   \item  use the calibration obtained on the small set as an initial value for
	  the global orientation;
\end{itemize}


The set for calibration can be a subset of the images used for the scene
reconstruction ; often having a separate acquisition  is preferable to
ensure that it fulfill all the requirements.
In the "Mur Saint Martin"  example, it is
a separate example;  the call to {\tt Tapas} can then be :


\begin{verbatim}
Tapas RadialExtended "IMGP416[0-5].JPG"  Out=Calib
Tapas AutoCal "IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG" InCal=Calib Out=Mur
\end{verbatim}

Some comments :

\begin{itemize}
   \item the first line is equivalent to~\ref{Basi:Tapas}, the only difference
	 is that the out directory is specified; here, the results are  then written
	 in {\tt Ori-Calib};


   \item in the second line, the argument {\tt InCal=Calib} specifies that for each
	 unknown calibration of focal $F$ , if there exist a file {\tt Ori-Calib/AutoCal(F*10).xml},
	 this file must be used as an initial value ; here, with a $28mm$ focal,
	 the file {\tt Ori-Calib/AutoCal280.xml} has been created by previous line
	 and is used;

    \item  here, with {\tt  ModeCalib=AutoCal}~\footnote{also with {\tt ModeCalib=Figee}},
	    when the file  {\tt Ori-Calib/AutoCal(F*10).xml} do not exist an error occurs;


    \item  with other mode of {\tt ModeCalib}
	   \footnote{RadialBasic, RadialExtended, Fraser, FishEyeEqui, HemiEqui}
	    when the file do not exist, a default initial value is created using
	    the {\tt ModeCalib}  as described in~\ref{Tap:Dis:Mod};
\end{itemize}


Figure~\ref{FIG:StM:OriMur} show a visualization of the orientation obtained, using
the program {\tt AperiCloud} described in~\ref{APERICLOUD}.

\section{Multiple lenses with Tapas}

\subsection{The Saint Martin Street data set}

The data set used in this section is still quite  basic
and a direct orientation of all the images should work; however it
illustrates a general strategy, proceeding in a kind of multi-scale approach,
that can be adapted for complex architectural modelizations;
in a two step version, for the acquisition phase, this approach
can for example be:

\begin{itemize}
   \item acquire with a short focal lenses, a set of images with a wide
	 overlapping that will form a highly connected set;

   \item acquire with a longer focal length convergent sets of images on
	  areas (possibly covering all the scene) interesting for $3d$ modelization;

   \item when acquiring the second set (longer focal) do not worry about
	 connectivity, as it will be the "job" of the first data set.
\end{itemize}

The data set is on directory {\tt StreetSaintMartin}\footnote{under {\tt micmac\_data/ExempleDoc/}}.
It has been made using a "zoom fisheye" at two different focals $10mm$ and $17mm$.
There is three subset of images :

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt IMGP4118.JPG} to {\tt IMGP4122.JPG} , $5$ images for the calibration
	  of the $10mm$;
    \item {\tt IMGP4123.JPG} to {\tt IMGP4151.JPG} , $29$ images of a narrow street,
	  mixing $10mm$ and $17mm$ focal; although the images have been acquired for
	  the purpose of the documentation \footnote{and  so the dataset is a bit artificial}
	 , one could imagine the $10mm$ are used for the global context and the $17mm$ is used for
	  modelization of some details (the $17mm$ are made of two convergent subset :
	  $44$ to $47$ and $48$ to $51$);  figure~\ref{FIG:StM:Rue} shows some
	  of the $10mm$ images and figure~\ref{FIG:StM:StrConv} shows some of the $17mm$ images;

    \item {\tt IMGP4152.JPG} to {\tt IMGP4158.JPG} , $7$ images for the calibration of
	  the $17mm$.

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{FIGS/StreetSainMartin/Planche-Rue.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Some of $10mm$-Saint martin's street photos}
\label{FIG:StM:Rue}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=30mm]{FIGS/StreetSainMartin/Small-IMGP4148.JPG}
\includegraphics[width=30mm]{FIGS/StreetSainMartin/Small-IMGP4149.JPG}

\end{center}
\caption{One of the  $17mm$-Saint martin's street subset}
\label{FIG:StM:StrConv}
\end{figure}


To obtain the necessary tie points, one can type (you can find it
inside the file {\tt ExCmd.txt}) :


\begin{verbatim}
Tapioca All "IMGP41((1[8-9])|(2[0-2])).JPG" 1000
Tapioca All "IMGP41((5[2-8])).JPG" 1000
Tapioca All "IMGP41((2[3-9])|[3-4][0-9]|(5[0-1])).JPG" 1000
\end{verbatim}



\subsection{Exploiting the data with {\tt Tapas}}

To exploit the acquisition strategy described above, a pertinent processing
strategy will be also separated in several steps; for example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  orientate at first the  short focal lenses, that will constitute the
	   global canvas
    \item  compute the orientations of other images based on the canvas of
	    the already oriented images;
\end{itemize}

Using this general strategy , with the Saint Martin Street dataset,
we would like to proceed this way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  compute the calibrations of the camera;
    \item  compute the orientations of the $10mm$ images only;
    \item  compute the orientations of the $17mm$ images,  in the same
	   coordinate system that the already oriented  $10mm$ images;
\end{itemize}

The following commands could realize this program :


\begin{verbatim}
Tapas FishEyeEqui   "IMGP41((1[8-9])|(2[0-2])).JPG"  Out=Calib10
Tapas FishEyeEqui   "IMGP41((5[2-8])).JPG"  Out=Calib17

Tapas AutoCal   "IMGP41((2[3-9])|[3-4][0-9]|(5[0-1])).JPG"  InCal=Calib10 Focs=[9,11] Out=Tmp1

cp Ori-Calib17/AutoCal170.xml Ori-Tmp1/
Tapas FishEyeEqui   "IMGP41((2[3-9])|[3-4][0-9]|(5[0-1])).JPG"  InOri=Tmp1  Out=all

AperiCloud "IMGP41((2[3-9])|[3-4][0-9]|(5[0-1])).JPG" all
\end{verbatim}

Let's comment  :

\begin{itemize}
   \item  the first two lines generates an initial calibration  with the calibration subsets;
	  it is quite similar to~\ref{Succ:Call:Tapas}, the difference being that the
	  {\tt FishEyeEqui} specifies that we have a fisheye;

   \item  the third line uses the  {\tt InCal} options, already seen;  it also
	  uses the option {\tt Focs=[9,11]}, the effect is   that only the images
	  with a focal lens between $9mm$ and $11mm$ will be loaded; so here we orientate
	  the $10mm$ subset;

   \item the line {\tt cp Ori\dots}, is necessary because we will need, on next call to Tapas,
	 to have all our required input on the same directory {\tt Ori-Tmp1}

    \item in the next call to {\tt Tapas}, we specify {\tt InOri=Tmp1},  this has two effects :

\begin{itemize}
	 \item  as before when files {\tt Ori-Tmp1/AutoCalXXX.xml} ( {\tt XXX} being the required focal) exist
		they are used to initialize intrinsic calibrations;

	 \item  when files  {\tt Ori-Tmp1/OrientationXXX.xml} ({\tt XXX} being the images
		name) exist they are used to initialize the \UNCLEAR{external orientations};%intrinsic calibration
\end{itemize}
    \item  so here, we will start directly from "good" initial value for both intrinsic calibration
	   and external orientation of $10mm$ images.

\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Camera data base and exif handling}

\subsection{How {\tt Tapas} initialize calibration}

For each camera it has to handle, when the user do not provide a calibration
file, {\tt Tapas} has to build an initial  value. For all parameters, but the
focal it's relatively easy :

\begin{itemize}
  \item for the distortion, the initial value is null \footnote{more
	precisely, it is the initial physical model, for example
	with fish-eye the initial value is a $\tan^{-1} $ function, see~\ref{SpGeo:FishEye}};

  \item for the principal point the initial value is at center of image
	\footnote{ of course, this wouldn't be suitable with shift lenses}.
\end{itemize}

For the focal lens Tapas must compute an initial value in pixel, this information is
computed with the help of xif data. To see some examples of xif data, go to MurSaint martin
and try {\tt ElDcraw -i -v} or {\tt exiv2} or {\tt exiftool} :

\begin{verbatim}
ElDcraw -i -v IMGP4182.JPG
...
Camera: PENTAX K-5
....
Focal length: 28.0 mm
Focal Equi35: 42.0 mm
....
\end{verbatim}

As the xif meta data never contains directly the focal in pixel,
several cases can  occure:

\begin{itemize}
  \item if the xif meta data contain the value $F_{35}$ of the focal in equivalent $35mm$
       \footnote{try {\tt ElDcraw FileName} to see}, then the focal is estimated by
       $\frac{F_{35} * W_{Pix}}{35.0}$, where $W_{Pix}$ is the width (= number)
       of image in pixel;

  \item if the xif meta data contain the value $F_{mm}$ of the focal in millimeter,
	and the width  $W_{mm}$  of the sensor is known in millimeter, the focal is estimated
	by $\frac{F_{mm} * W_{Pix}}{W_{mm}}$.

\end{itemize}

The size of the sensor is not a xif tag, so the information has to come from
somewhere else; this is the role of the camera data base.


\subsection{Camera data base}
\label{CamDB}

With all camera sold for people, xif meta data contain a tag indicating the
name of the camera.  For example you can see that the {\tt MurSaintMartin }
has been acquired with a {\tt PENTAX K-5} camera. This camera name is
used by the different tools as an entry in data bases containing  information
missing from xif files.

These data base can be located in three different files :

\begin{itemize}
   \item  {\tt  include/XML\_MicMac/DicoCamera.xml} , this global file always exist as
	 it is part of the {\tt MicMac} distribution, I put here the camera necessary
	 for the examples; I also update it when I meet a new camera
	 so that users can take benefit of it;
	 NEVER modify this file to add your own camera, as your may loose all your
	 modification at next update;

   \item  {\tt  include/XML\_User/DicoCamera.xml} , this file does not exist
	 when you make the first installation of MicMac; so you have to create it,
	 and put inside the description of all the camera that you will use
	 currently; as this file is not handled by subversion, there is no risk
	 of over writing it when you update;

   \item  {\tt  MicMac-LocalChantierDescripteur.xml},  in your working
	  directory when this file exists; the {\tt ENAC} example contains
	  an example of such usage;
\end{itemize}

Naturally, if the same camera is described in several files, the more local file has the
priority \footnote{e.q. {\tt MicMac-LocalChantierDescripteur.xml} highest priority
{\tt XML\_MicMac/DicoCamera.xml} lowest} .
Take a look at  {\tt  include/XML\_MicMac/DicoCamera.xml}, the structure is quite
simple :

\begin{itemize}
    \item a {\tt MMCameraDataBase} contains  a {\tt CameraEntry} for each  camera
	  to describe;
    \item a {\tt CameraEntry} contains :


     \begin{itemize}
	   \item a {\tt Name} that is used to make the link with information in xif file;
	   \item a {\tt SzCaptMm} that contains the size of sensor in millimeter;
	   \item a {\tt ShortName} which usage will be explained later  in~\ref{DB:Calib};
		(just give the value {\tt XXXX} until here)
     \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Indicating missing xif info}

Sometimes, the xif file does not contain the expected information. This can be the
case for example when images where acquired by industrial camera, or when the images
result from conversion by various software. In this case, the information can be indicated "dynamically"
by creating specific key in the {\tt  MicMac-LocalChantierDescripteur.xml}.

The {\tt ENAC} dataset illustrates this usage :

\begin{itemize}
    \item to indicate camera names, the user must define a rule
	   (see \ref{Ref:Key:Map}) of key  {\tt NKS-Assoc-STD-CAM}, this rule must
	   transform the name of the file into the name of the camera;
	   in {\tt ENAC} there is only one camera, the rule specify  then that,
	   whatever be the image name, the camera name will be {\tt TheGOPRO};


    \item to indicate focal length, the user must define a rule
	  of key {\tt NKS-Assoc-STD-FOC} that associate to each image name
	  its focal; here we have only one focal $3.8$, the rule is simple;


    \item the association mechanism described in \ref{Ref:Key:Map} may seem
	  over complicated, however it has to be very flexible to handle case
	  where there are several cameras or focal lengths not present in xif files;

\end{itemize}

Here is a copy of the ENAC's dataset MicMac-LocalChantierDescripteur.xml :


{\small
\begin{verbatim}
<Global>


  <ChantierDescripteur >


    <LocCamDataBase>

	<CameraEntry>
	      <Name> TheGOPRO  </Name>
	      <SzCaptMm>  4.9  8.7  </SzCaptMm>
	      <ShortName> TheGOPRO </ShortName>
	 </CameraEntry>
    </LocCamDataBase>


    <KeyedNamesAssociations>
	    <Calcs>
		 <Arrite>  1 1 </Arrite>
		 <Direct>
		       <PatternTransform> .*test[0-9]{4}.jpg  </PatternTransform>
		       <CalcName> TheGOPRO </CalcName>
		 </Direct>
	     </Calcs>
	     <Key>   NKS-Assoc-STD-CAM </Key>
    </KeyedNamesAssociations>
    <KeyedNamesAssociations>
	    <Calcs>
		 <Arrite>  1 1 </Arrite>
		 <Direct>
		       <PatternTransform> .*test[0-9]{4}.jpg  </PatternTransform>
		       <CalcName> 3.8 </CalcName>
		 </Direct>
	     </Calcs>
	     <Key>   NKS-Assoc-STD-FOC  </Key>
    </KeyedNamesAssociations>



  </ChantierDescripteur>
</Global>
\end{verbatim}
}





\subsection{Modifying  exif}

Another solution to deal with missing xif info is to use the
modifying facilities offered by the  exiv2 command .
I recommend that you read carefully
the exiv2 documentation before using it. Here is a short example,
without  any guarantee.

First create a command file, let name it {\tt Cmd.txt} with the appropriate syntax :

\begin{verbatim}
set Exif.Photo.FocalLength 120/1
set Exif.Photo.FocalLengthIn35mmFilm 180
\end{verbatim}

Then execute this command file on the desired images by something like :

\begin{verbatim}
exiv2 -m"Cmd.txt"  *.PEF
\end{verbatim}


    % - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{XML "cache" version of xif information}

As exif extraction can be relatively slow, since mercurial revision $3293$, there exist a
"cache" mechanism to save this xif information in {\tt xml} file and reload it more quickly.
The tool {\tt MMXmlXif} can be used for explicitly creating this files :

\begin{itemize}
   \item call {\tt mm3d MMXmlXif Pattern}
   \item  for each file {\tt aFile} in {\tt Pattern}, a xml version of the xif information is created in
	  {\tt Tmp-MM-Dir/aFile-MDT-$Num$.xml}  where $Num$ is some versioning number:
    \item when the exif information will be required, if the  xml file exist, it will be used to load it;
\end{itemize}

If for example with {\tt ENAC} data set you run {\tt mm3d MMXmlXif test00.*jpg}
you will have a file {\tt Tmp-MM-Dir/test0050.jpg-MDT-3293.xml} to contain :

\begin{verbatim}
<XmlXifInfo>
     <HGRev>3293</HGRev>
     <FocMM>3.79999999999999982</FocMM>
     <Foc35>16.4660314153628171</Foc35>
     <Sz>1280 720</Sz>
     <Cam>TheGOPRO</Cam>
     <BayPat>RVWB</BayPat>
</XmlXifInfo>
\end{verbatim}


In fact you probably do not need to explicitly call  {\tt MMXmlXif} as it called by {\tt Tapioca} and {\tt Tapas}
"just in case". For now, there is no way to avoid this mechanism \footnote{As there is no identified drawback}
, but if it happens to have unwanted side effect,
some option will be added to suppress it when necessary.




%-------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Using Raw images}

Sometime the images are in a pure Raw format, with no header describing the physical representation
of the image on hard disk. It is possible to use these images in {\tt Apero/MicMac} but user has
to explain the missing information. This is done this way :

\begin{itemize}
       \item for each kind of format create file containing a structure {\tt SpecifFormatRaw};

       \item in {\tt MicMac-LocalChantierDescripteur.xml} change the value of the key {\tt NKS-Assoc-SpecifRaw} to associate to each Raw images its file containing the {\tt SpecifFormatRaw};

\end{itemize}

An example is given in folder {\tt Documentation/NEW-DATA/RAW-IMAGES}. This case corresponds to :


\begin{itemize}

       \item a set of images with name {\tt "*.dlr"};

       \item each image has the same size $2448 * 2048$ and are $8$ bits unsigned integer images;

       \item in this case the optional {\tt <BayPat>} tag indicate that the image are bayer images;

       \item the {\tt <Focalmm>}, {\tt <FocalEqui35>} , {\tt <Camera>} tags are used to fit the minimal
	     xif information for using at the end in {\tt Apero/Tapas}.

\end{itemize}

If the tag {\tt <BayPat>} is present the image is interpreted as a color image acquired by bayer matrix
specified the string. If it is not present, images are considered  as gray scale images. This is
illustrated by figure~\ref{FIG:RawBayer}. This figure presents crops of results of the command
{\tt ConvertIm} with different value of {\tt <BayPat>} tag in the file {\tt  SpecRaw.xml}~:


\begin{itemize}
       \item left : with the correct value for these images ({\tt RGGB} here), a standard RGB value
	     is obtained;

       \item middle : the optional {\tt <BayPat>} tag is absent, the image is interpreted as a gray value
	     image (which generate the checkboard effect);

       \item right : a false value (here  {\tt GBRG}), the color are swapped.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=50mm]{FIGS/RawImages/Coul.jpg}

\end{center}
\caption{Results (crop) of command {\tt ConvertIm} with different value {\tt <BayPat>} : {\tt RGGB}, absent, {\tt GBRG}   }

\section{Other options of Tapas}

\subsection{Saving intermediar results with {\tt SauvAutom}}

\subsection{Forcing first image with {\tt ImInit}}

\subsection{Freezing poses with  {\tt FrozenPoses}}

The optional arg {\tt FrozenPoses} of {\tt Tapas}, can be used to indicate
a subset of images for which orientation will be frozen during all the
compensation;  {\tt FrozenPoses} is a generalized regular expression
(pattern or key) describing this subset.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Other tools for orientation}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{The tool {\tt AperiCloud}}
\label{APERICLOUD}

This section describes {\tt AperiCloud} a simplified version of the
{\tt <ExportNuage>} section of {\tt Apero} described in~\ref{Ap:Exp:Nuage}.


For example with Mur Saint Martin:

\begin{verbatim}
AperiCloud "./IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG" Mur
\end{verbatim}


Typing {\tt AperiCloud -help}, one gets:

\begin{verbatim}
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Unamed args :
  * string
  * string
Named args :
  * [Name=ExpTxt] INT
  * [Name=Out] string
  * [Name=Bin] INT
  * [Name=RGB] INT
\end{verbatim}

Meaning of args is:

\begin{itemize}
   \item First arg: pattern specifying the set of images ;
   \item Second  arg: pattern specifying the directory where orientations are located:
   \item optional {\tt ExpTxt}, def = $0$, set to $1$ if tie points are to be red in text format;
   \item optional {\tt Out}, def = AperiCloud.ply , specify the name of the generated ply file;
   \item optional {\tt Bin}, def = $1$ , set to  $0$  if ply file are to be generated in text format;
   \item optional {\tt RGB}, def = $1$ , set to  $0$  if the point are to be coloured with black
	  and white images (usefull to save time);
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{The tool {\tt Campari}}
\label{CAMPARI}

This section describes {\tt Campari} an interface to {\tt Apero}, for compensation
of heterogeneous measures, that is: tie points and ground control points.

\vspace{\baselineskip}
For example:

\begin{verbatim}
Campari "MyDir\IMG_.*.jpg" OriIn OriOut GCP=[GroundMeasures.xml,0.1,ImgMeasures.xml,0.5]
\end{verbatim}

Typing {\tt Campari -help}, one gets:

\begin{verbatim}
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Unamed args :
  * string :: {Full Directory (Dir+Pattern)}
  * string :: {Input Orientation}
  * string :: {Output Orientation}
Named args :
  * [Name=GCP] vector<std::string> :: {[GrMes.xml,GrUncertainty,ImMes.xml,ImUnc]
\end{verbatim}

Meaning of args is:

\begin{itemize}
   \item First arg: pattern specifying the set of images ;
   \item Second arg: pattern specifying the directory where orientations are located:
   \item Third arg: pattern specifying the directory where to write output orientations:
   \item optional {\tt GCP}, specifying the ground and image measures files, with their respective uncertainties;
\end{itemize}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
Mandatory part of GCP:
\begin{itemize}
\item xml file with 3D coordinates for GCP
\item GCP ground uncertainty
\item xml file with 2D coordinates for GCP
\item GCP image uncertainty
\end{itemize}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
The xml file containing 3D coordinates has to verify a specific format.
A tool to convert existing coordinates listing files into this format
is proposed with {\tt GCPConvert} and described in \ref{GCPConvert}.

The xml file containing 2D coordinates can be generated using interfaces
{\tt SaisieAppuisInit} and {\tt SaisieAppuisPredic} in Linux, described in \ref{SaisieAppuisInit}.

\vspace{\baselineskip}
For a detailed example on how to use {\tt Campari} in a typical aerial
surveying workflow, see \ref{Cuxa:DataSet}.

\subsubsection{Estimate lever-arm with the tool {\tt Campari}}
As seen, the tool {\tt Campari} deals with compensation of heterogeneous measures. Not only tie points
and ground control points but also GPS data. In direct georeferencing case for example, specially for UAV
acquisitions, one gets a GPS antenna on the top of the UAV and camera embedded on back side. The vector which separates
the phase center of the GPS antenna and the optical center of the camera is called : lever-arm vector. The value of
this vector expressed in the camera frame must be constant (in practice, very slight variations).
To include GPS data in the compensation and estimate lever-arm, for example :

\begin{verbatim}
mm3d Campari "MyDir\IMG_.*.jpg" OriIn OriOut GCP=[GroundMeasures.xml,0.1,ImgMeasures.xml,0.5]
 EmGPS=[Ori-Nav-Brut/,0.02,0.05] GpsLa=[0,0,0]
\end{verbatim}

The directory {\tt OriIn} must contain orientations in the same frame as the directory {\tt Ori-Nav-Brut/}. This
can be done with a relative orientation and ground control points using the tool {\tt GCPBascule} described
in \ref{Sec:GCPBascule} or even with the tool {\tt CenterBascule} described in \ref{Sec:CenterBascule}.

\vspace{\baselineskip}
Typing {\tt Campari -help}, one gets:

\begin{verbatim}
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Unamed args :
  * string :: {Full Directory (Dir+Pattern)}
  * string :: {Input Orientation}

  * [Name=GpsLa] Pt3dr :: {Gps Lever Arm, in combinaision  with EmGPS}
\end{verbatim}

Meaning of optional args is:

\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt EmGPS}, specifying the directory where orientations generated from GPS data are located; this directory
   can be generated from a file using the tool {\tt OriConvert} described in \ref{OriConvert}. The uncertainty for the height component,
   for GPS coordinates, must be different from the uncertainty of the horizontal components. These values ​​depend on
   if GPS coordinates are derived from a processing based on pseudo-range (2-5 m) or carrier-phase measurements (1-5 cm). Also, these
   values are the same for all GPS coordinates
   \item {\tt GpsLa}, the initial value of the lever arm vector expressed in the camera frame
\end{itemize}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
What is displayed while {\tt Campari} running :
\begin{verbatim}

For each image, value of residual is given with the estimated value of lever-arm in camera frame. The LA value is the same
for all images.

\subsubsection{Bundle adjustment with pushbroom sensor}\label{subsub:rpcCampari}
This section describes how to utilize the Campari simplified tool to refine the orientation parameters provided in form of the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). 

\vspace{\baselineskip}
Typing {\tt Campari -help}, one gets:

\begin{verbatim}
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Unamed args :
  * string :: {Full Directory (Dir+Pattern)}
  * string :: {Input Orientation}
  * string :: {Output Orientation}
Named args :
  * [Name=AcceptGB] bool :: {Accepte new Generik Bundle image, 
                             Def=true, set false for perfect backward compatibility} 
\end{verbatim}

The optional arg \texttt{AcceptGB} indicates a generic input camera geometry (central perspective, RPCs, GRIDs). If cameras defined by RPCs are handled (which \texttt{MicMac} will automatically find out given the convention of the input orientation files), the trajectory of the satellite platform is fixed within the adjustment, and only small camera rotations are estimated. The rotations are forced to cause pixel displacements in the sensor's plane being equal to a 2D polynomial function. The coefficients of the functions likewise act as observed unknowns in the adjustment (see Rupnik \& Pierrot-Deseilligny, (2016)).

\section{The Bascule's tools}

\subsection{Generalities}

\label{BASCULE}
This section, describe the simplified version of the {\tt <BasculeOrientation>} mechanisms
described in~\ref{SC:Base:Or}. This mechanisms is used when global transformation of the
orientation is required. The tools for bascule are :

\begin{itemize}

   \item {\tt SBGlobBascule}  is a tool for "scene based global" bascule,
	 it is used when no absolute information is available but the user
	 still wishes to give some physical meaning to the orientation;

   \item {\tt GCPBascule}  for using ground control point (GCP) to make
	 a global transformation from a generally purely relative orientation
	 to an orientation in the system of the GCP;

   \item {\tt RepLocBascule} a tool useful to define a local repair without
	 changing the orientation;

   \item {\tt CenterBascule}  for using embedded GPS on submit  to make
	 a global transformation from a generally purely relative orientation
	 to an absolute orientation;

   \item   the {\tt Bascule} used to do, more a less, all of the previous
	   functionality; it is obsolete, still maintained for compatibility,
	   but no longer documented;
\end{itemize}


	%  -    -    -    -    -    -    -     -
\subsubsection{Scene based orientation with {\tt SBGlobBascule}}

\label{ScBas:Basc}

A current case in architectural modeling, is when a part of the
scene is \emph{globally} plane and we want to do computation in
coordinate system where this plane is the horizontal plane.
This can be done with the tool {\tt SBGlobBascule}:



\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt SBGlobBascule} use a selected number of images, on which the
	 user has created mask, these mask must define part of the image
	 belonging to the plane (see figure~\ref{FIG:MaskPlane:StMartin} as an
	 example);

   \item {\tt SBGlobBascule} select the tie points belonging to the mask, and
	 compute by least square fitting an estimation of this  plane;


   \item finally {\tt SBGlobBascule} compute the rotation that transform
	 current coordinates in a new system where the fitted plane correspond to
	 the plane $Z=0$;

    \item {\tt SBGlobBascule}  fix  also the orientation inside the plane;

    \item optionally {\tt SBGlobBascule}  can fix the  the global scale;
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=50mm]{FIGS/MurSaintMartin/Plan1.jpg}
\includegraphics[width=50mm]{FIGS/MurSaintMartin/Plan2.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Example of masks defining a plane}
\label{FIG:MaskPlane:StMartin}
\end{figure}


With the dataset of street Saint Martin, an example of use is :

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
SBGlobBascule "IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG" Mur MesureBasc.xml  LocBasc PostPlan=_MasqPlan  DistFS=0.6
\end{verbatim}}

The meaning of the arguments are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item first arg, is the pattern defining the image we want to use;

  \item second arg {\tt Mur} defines the input orientation;

  \item third arg {\tt MesureBasc.xml} is a file that contains image measurement
	for defining orientation;

  \item fourth  arg {\tt Basc} defines the output orientation;

  \item optional args {\tt PostPlan=\_MasqPlan}  means that if image is {\tt IMGP4171.JPG}
	(or {\tt IMGP4171.CR2} or \dots), then the associated mask {\tt IMGP4171\_MasqPlan.tif}. Else,
	if {\tt PostPlan=NONE} means that no mask is available and we do not want to change the input orientation and
	may be only want to fix its scale; 

   \item  if there are several masks it will use all them for
	 fitting the plane (which can be useful with wide dataset when high accuracy  is required);

  \item optional args {\tt DistFS=0.6} is used to fix the scale;
\end{itemize}


Open the file {\tt MesureBasc.xml}, you will see that it contains measurement
of points in image. Although the syntax should be quite obvious, it is
described in section~\ref{GCP:Org}. To create a file like {\tt MesureBasc.xml}
user can of course do it with a text editor, alternatively he can, on Linux,
use the interactive tool {\tt SaisieBasc}  described in \ref{SaisieBasc}.
Once created, the following information will be looked for by  {\tt SBGlobBascule}
in this file:

\begin{itemize}
   \item measurement of points named {\tt Line1} and  {\tt Line2};
	 they will fix orientation in the plane by imposing that line
	   {\tt Line1-Line2} is parallel to $Ox$;

   \item these points need only to be measured in one image, as they are
	 assumed  to be in the plane  computed on the mask; if they have been
	 measured several times, a warning will occur;

   \item optionally a point {\tt Origine} to fix the origin of the repair;

   \item optionally two points {\tt Ech1} and {\tt Ech2} to fix the scale,
	 each point must be measured in two images, so that a $3d$ position
	 can be computed; when {\tt DistFS} is entered, new coordinate system
	 is computed with the constraint that the distance between the $3d$
	 positions of {\tt Ech1} and {\tt Ech2} is equal to {\tt DistFS} ;
	 if {\tt DistFS} is entered and {\tt Ech1} and {\tt Ech2} do not
	 exist in at least two images, an error occurs;
\end{itemize}
~\\
To have the full syntax, as usual:

\begin{verbatim}
mm3d SBGlobBascule -help
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Mandatory unnamed args : 
  * string :: {Full name (Dir+Pat)}

  * [Name=Rep] string :: {Target coordinate system (Def = ki, ie normal is vertical)}
  * [Name=CPI] bool :: {Calibration Per Image (Def=false)}
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt Rep} is decsribed in section~\ref{SGB:Rep}.


	%  -    -    -    -    -    -    -     -
\subsubsection{Geo-referencing with {\tt GCPBascule}}

\label{Sec:GCPBascule}

In the Mur Saint Martin data set, you can find two files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt Ground-Pts3D.xml} contains the definition of $3$D points, using
	the syntax detailed in ~\ref{GCP:Org};
  \item {\tt GroundMeasure.xml}  contains the $2$D measurement of these points
	in images, using the syntax detailed in ~\ref{GCP:Org}.
\end{itemize}


The {\tt GCPBascule} command, allows to transform a purely relative orientation,
as computed with {\tt Tapas}, in an absolute one, as soon as there is at least
$3$ GCP whose projection are known in at least $2$  images. Here for example:


\begin{verbatim}
GCPBascule   "IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG" Mur Ground Ground-Pts3D.xml GroundMeasure.xml
\end{verbatim}

To know the syntax of {\tt GCPBascule} :
\begin{verbatim}
  GCPBascule  -help
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Unnamed args :
  * string :: {Full name (Dir+Pat)}
  * string :: {Orientation in}
  * string :: {Orientation out}
  * string :: {File for Ground Control Points}
  * string :: {File for Image Measurements}
Named args :
  * [Name=L1] bool :: {L1 minimization vs L2; (Def=false)}
\end{verbatim}


The meaning should be quite obvious:

\begin{itemize}
  \item  first arg defines the set of images, which you want to change orientation;
  \item  secong arg defines the location of input orientations (generally it will be purely relative
	 orientation generated using {\tt Tapas} as described above);


  \item  third arg defines the location of output orientation that will be generated by {\tt GCPBascule}

  \item fourth arg defines the file containing the GCP and their $3d$ measures ;
  \item fifth arg defines the file containing the image measurement of GCP;
  \item  optional arg {\tt L1} indicates if the transformation from relative to absolute
	 must be done using $L_1$ or $L_2$ minimization ( as currently the  measurements
	 will have some redundancy).
\end{itemize}

Although it is generally difficult to analyze in detail the results of orientation
by inspecting the file, you can check quickly that there is some coherence in the result.
For example if you type {\tt grep Centre Ori-Ground/*}, you get:


{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
Ori-Ground/Orientation-IMGP4167.JPG.xml:               <Centre>5.2020...  1.4890...  2.1157...</Centre>
Ori-Ground/Orientation-IMGP4168.JPG.xml:               <Centre>5.2002...  0.7974...  2.1018...</Centre>
 ...
Ori-Ground/Orientation-IMGP4177.JPG.xml:               <Centre>4.1747... -3.4504...  2.1690...</Centre>
 ...
Ori-Ground/Orientation-IMGP4182.JPG.xml:               <Centre>3.7778... -6.1801...  2.2321...</Centre>
Ori-Ground/Orientation-IMGP4183.JPG.xml:               <Centre>3.6802... -6.6812...  2.2037...</Centre>
\end{verbatim}
}

So you can verify that in the ground repair, where $Z$ axis coincides with the vertical,
all the image center are approximately at the same height, which is quite coherent with
the acquisition I did.

See also~\ref{NonLin:GCPBascule} for non linear transformation using more GCP.

\subsubsection{Creating local repair with {\tt RepLocBascule}}

\label{Sec:RepLocBascule}

When {\tt MicMac} and derived tools are used in ground geometry, the
default convention is:

\begin{itemize}
   \item  for rectification, the images are  generated with $Z=Cste$ ;
   \item  for matching, the generated grid represents $Z=f(x,y)$ ;
\end{itemize}


These conventions are perfectly ok in aerial photogrammetry,
the context  in which {\tt MicMac} was originally developed. However,
it won't work in architectural context, to make the orthophoto of a
vertical wall in some ground coordinate system where $Z$ axis  is vertical.
For example, suppose we want to use the rectification tool {\tt Tarama} (see~\ref{Sec:Tarama})
with the orientation {\tt Ground} defined, in~\ref{Sec:GCPBascule}.
If we type :

\begin{verbatim}
Tarama "IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG" Ground Zoom=32
\end{verbatim}

Then we get the "rectified" image of figure ~\ref{FIG:PBRec:StMartin}. This
is probably not what we wanted.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=120mm]{FIGS/MurSaintMartin/TA_PB_LeChantier.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Problem with Tarama applied directly in ground geometry}
\label{FIG:PBRec:StMartin}
\end{figure}

In such case, what we want to do is to define, for the matching, rectification \dots
purpose a \emph{local} repair with $Z$ axis orthogonal to the wall. These local repairs
will not be used to change the orientation (we want to maintain all the data in the
same ground coordinate system), but they will be used to specify, during matching
and rectification, a geometry adapted to the scene.
The command to define such repair is {\tt RepLocBascule}, the syntax is:

\begin{verbatim}
RepLocBascule -help
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Unnamed args :
  * string :: {Full name (Dir+Pat)}
  * string :: {Input Orientation}
  * string :: {XML File of Images Measures}
  * string :: {Out Xml File to store the results"}
Named args :
  * [Name=ExpTxt] bool :: {Are tie point in ascii mode ? (Def=false)}
  * [Name=PostPlan] string :: {Pots fix for plane name, (Def=_Masq)}
  * [Name=OrthoCyl] bool :: {Is the repere in ortho-cylindric mode ?}
\end{verbatim}

The meaning of the three first args is similar to {\tt SBGlobBascule}. The fourth
arg specifies the output xml file.

In the data set of Mur Saint Martin, one could type:

\begin{verbatim}
RepLocBascule "IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG" Ground MesureBasc.xml RepCorr.xml PostPlan=_MasqPlan
\end{verbatim}

The generated XML file {\tt RepCorr.xml} contains the necessary information to
describe a local repair: an origin and $3$ axis. Here:

\begin{verbatim}
<RepereLoc>
     <RepereCartesien>
	  <Ori>-0.0303368933943062302 0.0014864175131534263 -0.0145221323781670186</Ori>
	  <Ox>-0.00848394971784020499 0.99996077502067815 -0.00254381941768354975</Ox>
	  <Oy>-0.00208480031723078411 0.00252621752215371033 0.99999463590194726</Oy>
	  <Oz>0.999961837374218176 0.00848920756463100723 0.00206328623854717171</Oz>
     </RepereCartesien>
</RepereLoc>
\end{verbatim}

Next sections will describe how they can be used. The general principle is
simply to give these repair as optional argument to the program. For
example:

\begin{verbatim}
Tarama "IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG" Ground  Repere=RepCorr.xml
\end{verbatim}

This will generate the rectified image of figure~\ref{FIG:OkRec:StMartin}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=120mm]{FIGS/MurSaintMartin/TA_OK-LeChantier.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Rectified image using the local repair}
\label{FIG:OkRec:StMartin}
\end{figure}



%   centerbascule -----------------------


\subsubsection{Geo-referencing with {\tt CenterBascule}}\label{Sec:CenterBascule}


In the UAS Grand-Leez data set, you can find the file {\tt GPS\_WPK\_Grand-Leez.csv} which contains embedded GPS and aircraft attitude data. These data are converted with {\tt OriConvert} (section \ref{OriConvert}) in a data base of center, which have a similar structure than an orientation database.

The {\tt CenterBascule} tool allows to transform a purely relative orientation,
as computed with {\tt Tapas}, in an absolute one. Here for example:

\begin{verbatim}
CenterBascule "R.*.JPG" All-Rel Nav-adjusted-RTL All-RTL
\end{verbatim}

To know the syntax of {\tt CenterBascule} :
\begin{verbatim}
	CenterBascule -help
Unnamed args :
  * string :: {Full name (Dir+Pat)}
  * string :: {Orientation in}
  * string :: {Localization of Information on Centers}
  * string :: {Orientation out}
Named args :
  * [Name=L1] bool :: {L1 minimization vs L2; (Def=false)}
  * [Name=CalcV] bool :: {Use speed to estimate time delay (Def=false)}
\end{verbatim}

The meaning of the arguments is:

\begin{itemize}
  \item  first arg defines the set of images, which you want to change orientation;
  \item  second arg defines the location of input orientations (generally it will be purely relative
	 orientation generated using {\tt Tapas} as described above);
  \item third arg defines the location of the data base of center;
  \item fourth arg defines the location of output orientation that will be generated by {\tt CenterBascule}
  \item optional arg {\tt L1} indicates if the transformation from relative to absolute
	 must be done using $L_1$ or $L_2$ minimization ( as currently the  measures
	 will have some redundancy).
	\item optional arg {\tt CalcV} indicates if GPS delay has to be computed from camera relative speed (see \ref{OriConvert}).
\end{itemize}

The command line {\tt grep Centre All-RTL/*} enable you to quickly check the result.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Merging Orientation with {\tt Morito}}\label{Sec:Morito}

When one has $2$ sets of orientation, with at least $2$ images common to the two sets, the  {\tt Morito} command
can be used to merge the two orientations.

An example with the Cuxha Data set, first we create (a bit artificially here) two set of images:

\begin{verbatim}
Tapas RadialBasic  "Abbey-IMG_02[4-8].*.jpg" Out=48
Tapas Figee  "Abbey-IMG_02[0-4].*.jpg" Out=04 InCal=Ori-48/
\end{verbatim}

Note that for obvious coherence reason, we have force the two set of images to have the same internal orientation.
Now we want to merge this two orientations, taking benefit that images {\tt IMG\_0240.jpg \dots IMG\_0249.jpg} are common to the two subsets. We use:

\begin{verbatim}
mm3d Morito Ori-48/Orientation-Abbey-IMG_02.*xml  Ori-04/Orientation-Abbey-IMG_02.*xml 08
\end{verbatim}

The merged orientation are in {\tt Ori-48/}, the progrmm has estimated a $3d$ similitude ($7$ parameter) to do the merging. The merging is done in the system of the first set of images.  As the system is redundant, the residual can be used as estimation of the accuracy. They are printed by {\tt Morito} , the {\tt DMatr} represent the residual in rotation and {\tt DPt} the residual in center :


\begin{verbatim}
...
Orientation-Abbey-IMG_0240.jpg.xml DMatr 0.000457438 DPt 0.000962311
Orientation-Abbey-IMG_0247.jpg.xml DMatr 0.000374341 DPt 0.000914102
Orientation-Abbey-IMG_0248.jpg.xml DMatr 0.00018792 DPt 0.000749945
Orientation-Abbey-IMG_0249.jpg.xml DMatr 0.000361987 DPt 0.000892905
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Accuracy Control with {\tt GCPCtrl}}\label{Sec:GCPCtrl}

In photogrammetry, a standard method to control the accuracy of georeferencing result is to use couple of points called Check Points (CP). 
Check points, unlike Ground Control Points (GCPs), are used either to estimate the $3d$ similarity ({\tt GCPBascule}) or for the compensation ({\tt Campari}) on ground measurements. Residuals on check points allow to qualify the accuracy of the georeferencing result.


If for a dataset, several ground measurements are available, a part may serve to perform georeferencing step ({\tt GCPBascule}) while the rest of ground measurements can be used to qualify the accuracy and used as check points. An example of the use of {\tt GCPCtrl}:


\begin{verbatim}
mm3d GCPCtrl ".*JPG" Ori-RTL-Bascule CP.xml MesuresFinales-S2D.xml
\end{verbatim}


Where:


\begin{itemize}
\item Ori-RTL-Bascule : are sets of orientations computed using Ground Control Points with ({\tt GCPBascule})
\item CP.xml : are Check Points coordinates (not used to compute orientations of Ori-RTL-Bascule)
\item MesuresFinales-S2D.xml : $2d$ Check Points coordinates
\end{itemize}


Residuals are used to estimate the accuracy. It is printed by {\tt GCPCtrl} where {\tt D} is the 3d residual and {\tt P} is vector of deviations in axial components:


\begin{verbatim}
...
Ctrl 1 GCP-Bundle, D=0.00711013 P=[0.00157584,0.00215343,0.0065904]

\section{Tools for full automatic  matching}

This section is incomplete.

\label{FullAutoMatch}

\subsection{The tortue data set}

This data set is made  of $53$ photo acquired to model a statue of a tortoise in the
pagode of Hue (Vietnam), see figure ~\ref{FIG:Tortue:Input} . Although I take some precaution when taking the images,
with several point of view having "optimal" angles for stereoscopy, I did not take any
note; in these situation,  it is hard and boring for a human to recover \emph{a posteriori} the organization
of the acquisition. This is a typical situation where to use these tools.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=60mm]{FIGS/Tortue/AllTortues.jpg}

\end{center}
\caption{Set of tortoise images and visualization of orientation with AperiCloud}
\label{FIG:Tortue:Input}
\end{figure}




The processing begins classically with tie points and orientation :

\begin{verbatim}
Tapioca MulScale ".*JPG" 400 1500
Tapas RadialBasic "IMGP68(5[0-9]|6[0-5]).*JPG" Out=Calib
Tapas RadialStd ".*JPG" InOri=Calib Out=All
\end{verbatim}

The result of orientation can be seen in figure ~\ref{FIG:Tortue:Input}.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{The tool {\tt AperoChImSecMM}}

To compute \emph{a posteriori} the structure of an acquisition, the first thing is to know,
for each potential master image, what would be the best set of secondary  images.
This is what does the tool {\tt AperoChImSecMM}. The meaning of its argument should be
quite obvious from inline help :

\begin{verbatim}
$ mm3d AperoChImSecMM
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Unnamed args :
  * string :: {Dir + Pattern}
  * string :: {Orientation}
Named args :
  * [Name=ExpTxt] bool :: {Have tie point been exported in text format (def = false)}
  * [Name=Out] string :: {Out Put destination (Def= same as Orientation-parameter)}
\end{verbatim}

Using it with the tortoise data-set we enter :

\begin{verbatim}
 mm3d AperoChImSecMM ".*JPG" All
\end{verbatim}

For further use, it is not strictly necessary to understand what is done
 by {\tt AperoChImSecMM}; however, it  can never be bad to understand the tool you use
\footnote{at least, this is the "philosophy" with free open source products} \dots
When it is finished, we can take a look at  {\tt Ori-All} directory, it
contains $53$ files  {\tt ImSec-XXXX.xml}. Each file contains possible sets of secondary images.
For example, if we open {\tt ImSec-IMGP6857.JPG.xml}  :

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
<ImSecOfMaster>
     <Master>IMGP6857.JPG</Master>

     </Sols>
\end{verbatim}
}

Each {\tt Sol} contains a possible set of secondary images. There are several sets because there is no universal
criteria to define the best set : it must covers  all the direction around the master image
(to avoid hidden part), it must contains images with the "good" angles for stereoscopy, it
must avoid redundancy and have a minimal number of images (for efficiency). A these criteria
are generally contradictory, {\tt AperoChImSecMM} propose an optimal set for each cardinal
(between $2$ and $6$). Although to facilitate an automatic exploitation, each set has an
associated score. Here the "best" set according to {\tt AperoChImSecMM} has $4$ image with
a score of $0.663....$.

These result will be used implicitly in the following automatic tools. It is also possible to use them explicitly
"by hand" in creating your own {\tt xml} file for {\tt MicMac} \footnote{Use in {\tt Malt} will come soon}.
See for example of how to use this inside {\tt MICMAC} the section {\tt ImSecCalcApero} of file
{\tt include/XML\_MicMac/MM-TieP.xml}.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{The tool {\tt MMInitialModel}}

The tool {\tt MMInitialModel} is used to create fully automatically a regularly dense but coarse $3D$ model
out of a set of images. Although its main purpose is to create a model that will be used
to drive future tools, it can already be used now for those who only need a regular coarse 3D model.
This tool requires that the {\tt AperoChImSecMM} command has been executed before.
The syntax is:

\begin{verbatim}
$ mm3d MMInitialModel
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Unnamed args :
  * string :: {Dir + Pattern}
  * string :: {Orientation}
Named args :
  * [Name=Visu] bool :: {Interactif Visualization (tuning purpose, program will stop at breakpoint)}
  * [Name=DoPly] bool :: {Generate ply ,for tuning purpose, (Def=false)}
  * [Name=Zoom] INT :: {Zoom of computed models, (def=8)}
  * [Name=ReduceExp] REAL :: {Down scaling of cloud , XML and ply, (def = 3)}
\end{verbatim}

When using it now, do not forget the arg {\tt \bf DoPly=1}, else you won't get any ply file! An example of use :


\begin{verbatim}
mm3d MMInitialModel ".*JPG" All  DoPly=1
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{FIG:Tortue:Output} present the result of this command.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=60mm]{FIGS/Tortue/snapshot00.jpg}
\includegraphics[width=60mm]{FIGS/Tortue/snapshot01.jpg}

\end{center}
\caption{Some view point of the coarse model create with MMInitialModel on tortoise data-set}
\label{FIG:Tortue:Output}
\end{figure}



For curious users who wants to see the real time progression,  the {\tt Visu=1} option can be
used on system where {\tt X11} is installed. Of course, it's then better to use it with only one
image. For example try :


\begin{verbatim}
mm3d MMInitialModel IMGP6857.JPG All Visu=1
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{FIG:Tortue:Dump} presents some snapshot of the windows obtained when using
this option.

\begin{figure}

\label{FIG:Tortue:Dump}
\end{figure}



%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The tool {\tt MMTestAllAuto}}

The tool {\tt MMTestAllAuto} is a \emph{precursor} of the fully automatic tool that will
be executed, driven by the coarse model of {\tt MMInitialModel} . It assumes that  {\tt AperoChImSecMM}
has been executed, and compute a "fine" 3D model for a given master image using a predefined parametrization
of {\tt MICMAC}.

The tool works generally well when the master image has "good" secondary image. Conversely,
the  result can be almost empty in the other cases. Figure~\ref{FIG:Tortue:AllAuto} illustrates the
results.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\caption{Illustration of the {\tt MMTestAllAuto} tool; up two views where it works correctly;
down one view (and it corresponding original image) where, due to lack of good secondary image,

\section{Tools for simplified semi-automatic matching}

\label{SemiAutoMatch}

Even when the full automatic matching will be available, many users will need to have
in some circumstances a finer control of the process. This is the aim of these tools.

\subsection{Basic rectification with {\tt Tarama}}

\label{Sec:Tarama}

To run the matching process (with {\tt MicMac} or {\tt Malt}) the
program must decide which space has to be explored. If no
information is given, the program will adopt a default strategy: it
will select points of the scene that are visible on at least $N$ images
\footnote{generally $N=2$ or $N=3$},
making the assumption that the scene is globally flat. Although this
strategy may be perfectly ok on aerial acquisition, in the the general
case it may create a uselessly too large area. In general case, the
area selection requires some semantic interpretation of the scene
and can only be made by, you, the user who only knows what he wants.
For example, in the Saint Martin data set, an automatic program has no
information to determine that you want to do the matching on the wall
and not on the street.

An easy way to indicate which part of the scene you want to use,
is to create a mask on a rectified mosaic. The tool Tarama allows
to create such mosaic. At this step the relief is unknown and the
rectification is made with the assumption that $Z=ZMoy$, so of
course these mosaic are not very accurate.

The syntax is:

\begin{verbatim}
 Tarama -help
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Unnamed args :
  * string :: {Full Image (Dir+Pat)}
  * string :: {Orientation}
Named args :
  * [Name=Zoom] INT :: {Resolution, (Def=8, must be pow of 2)}
  * [Name=Repere] string :: {local repair as created with RepLocBascule}
  * [Name=Out] string :: {directory for output (Deg=TA)}
\end{verbatim}

The meaning of the two first mandatory arguments should be quite obvious now.
For the optional arguments:

\begin{itemize}
   \item  {\tt Zoom} indicates the resolution of the mosaic, it must be a power
	  of $2$ as it is made using the image pyramid of {\tt MicMac};

   \item  {\tt Repere} indicates and optional repair created by {\tt RepLocBascule}
	  as described in~\ref{Sec:RepLocBascule}
   \item {\tt Out} describes the directory where the mosaic will be created.
\end{itemize}

With the Mur Saint Martin data set,  using the orientation created with
{\tt SBGlobBascule} (\ref{ScBas:Basc}), one can type:

\begin{verbatim}
Tarama "IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG" LocBasc
\end{verbatim}

The mosaic image will creatd on {\tt TA/TA\_LeChantier.tif}.
Figure~\ref{FIG:Rectif:StMartin} shows the result.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=120mm]{FIGS/MurSaintMartin/TA_LeChantier.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Result of Tarama of Mur Saint Martin data set}
\label{FIG:Rectif:StMartin}
\end{figure}


Example using local repair, have be done in~\ref{Sec:RepLocBascule}.



\subsection{Simplified matching in ground geometry with {\tt Malt}}\label{subsec:Malt}

\subsubsection{General characteristics}

{\tt Malt} is a simplified  interface to  {\tt MicMac}. Currently it can
handle matching in ground geometry (see~\ref{Ground:Geom}) and
ground-image geometry (see~\ref{EX:TER:IM:GEOM}).


Ground geometry is adapted
when the scene can be described by a single function $Z=f(X,Y)$ (with $X,Y,Z$
being euclidean coordinates); this case occurs quite often when the
scene is relatively flat and the acquisition is made by photo acquired
orthogonaly to the main plane. The main use cases are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  modelization of facades to generate ortho photo in architecture;
    \item  modelization of earth surface from aerial acquisition;
\end{itemize}

Ground image geometry is very general and flexible and can be used in
almost all acquisition. Its main drawbacks is that it requires~\footnote{for
now, I hope it will change in $2013$} some interaction to select the master images,
the mask of these images and  the associated secondary images.

The basic syntax requires $3$ args:

\begin{verbatim}
Malt Type Pattern Orient
\end{verbatim}

The meaning being:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  first args is a enumerated value, specifying the kind of matching required;
	   the two possible values are:

     \begin{itemize}
	  \item {\bf \tt Ortho} , for a matching adapted to ortho photo generation;
	  \item {\bf \tt UrbanMNE} , for a matching adapted to urban digital elevation model;
	  \item {\bf \tt GeomImage} , for a matching in ground image geometry;
     \end{itemize}


    \item  second arg specifies the subset of images;
    \item  third arg specifies the orientation;
\end{itemize}


An example with data set of Mur Saint Martin:


\begin{verbatim}
Malt Ortho "./IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG" Basc
\end{verbatim}



A basic help can be asked with {\tt Malt -help}:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
Malt -help
Valid Types for enum value:
   Ortho

*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************

  * [Name=2Ortho] bool :: {Do both anamorphosed ans un-anamorphosed ortho (when applyable) }

  * [Name=ZMoy] REAL :: {Average value of Z}
  * [Name=Spherik] bool :: {If true the surface for redressing are spheres}
\end{verbatim}
}

For  optional parameters, the default value generally depends on the first
parameter. For example the parameter {\tt SzW}, defines the correlation
windows size, its default value is:


\begin{itemize}
   \item $1$ (ie window $3x3$) for DEM urban generation and ground image geometry
	  because we want to preserve discontinuities;
   \item $2$ (ie window $5x5$) for ortho generation, because priority here is robustness;
\end{itemize}

As usual these default values can be changed explicitly, for example:


\begin{verbatim}
Malt Ortho "./IMGP41((6[7-9])|([7-8][0-9])).JPG" Basc SzW=5
\end{verbatim}



\subsubsection{Optional parameters}

Table~\ref{Tab:ArgMalt} presents a summary of meaning and default value of
{\tt Malt} parameters;

\begin{figure}
\begin{tabular} { c | p{5 cm} | c | c | c}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Default values of malt parameters according to main options}
\label{Tab:ArgMalt}
\end{figure}

Some comments:

\begin{itemize}
   \item  the {\tt ZPas} does not specify directly a value in ground geometry;
	 for a given value of a the {\tt ZPas} parameters,  {\tt MICMAC} will compute
	 the step, in ground geometry, such that, two consecutive projected point in images are
	 on average separated of {\tt ZPas};
	 in the simple case where there would be two images, with a constant base-to-height ratio $R=\frac{B}{H}$,
	 the step in ground geometry would be $\frac{ZPas}{R}$,

   \item the {\tt NbVI}   
   \item Warning : If you use {\tt UseGpu} and {\tt GeomImage}, it's not a matching in ground image geometry, but in geometry terrain.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Image geometry with {\tt Malt}}

An example of using {\tt Malt} in mode {\tt GeomImage}
with the {\tt Ramses} data set:

\begin{verbatim}
Malt GeomImage ".*CR2" All Master=IMG_0355.CR2
\end{verbatim}

There are some specificities when using {\tt Malt} in the mode {\tt GeomImage}:

\begin{itemize}
   \item  {\tt Master} parameter must have a value, as it is the only way to
	  distinguish the master image from the global set of image given by the pattern;
   \item masq is not search in {\tt TA/TA\_LeChantier.tif}; if, for example,
	 the master  image is {\tt IMG\_0355.CR2} then masq is {\tt IMG\_0355\_Masq.tif}
	 for example
   \item directory storing results depends on the master image, with {\tt IMG\_0355.CR2}
	 it will be  {\tt MM-Malt-Img-IMG\_0355};

\end{itemize}


See~\ref{Analog:Image} for an example of using the {\tt Spherik} option.

\section{Ortho photo generation}

The simplified tool for generating ortho mosaic is {\tt Tawny}, it is
an interface to the {\tt Porto} tool described in~\ref{Porto}.
Using {\tt Tawny} is quite simple because it assumes that data have been correctly prepared and organized during matching
process. Practically this is done when matching has been made using
{\tt Malt} and I recommend to only use {\tt Tawny} in conjunction with
{\tt Malt}. In Ortho Mode, {\tt Malt} has created a set of
individual ortho images, associated mask, incidence image, \dots in
a directory {\tt Ortho-MEC-Malt/}; see for example~\ref{FIG:Malt:Input}.
 The job of {\tt Tawny} is essentially to merge these data and to optionally do some
radiometric equalization.



\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=60mm]{FIGS/MurSaintMartin/Ort_IMGP4182.jpg}
\includegraphics[width=60mm]{FIGS/MurSaintMartin/PC_IMGP4182.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Individual ortho image, and mask image for image {\tt IMGP4182.jpg}}
\label{FIG:Malt:Input}
\end{figure}




For the radiometric equalization, {\tt Tawny}  will compute for each
individual ortho image $O_i$, a polynom $P_i$ such that, $\forall i,j,x,y$
where ortho image $O_i$ and $O_j$ are both defined in $x,y$ we have relation:

\begin{equation}
   O_i(x,y) P_i(x,y) = O_j(x,y) P_j(x,y)
\label{Eq:Rad:PolIndiv}
\end{equation}


The problem with such formula is that it can lead to important drift in radiometry.
So there is also a global polynom $R$ that is computed, this polynom is such that:

\begin{equation}
   O_i(x,y) P_i(x,y) R(x,y) =  O_i(x,y)
\label{Eq:Rad:PolGlob}
\end{equation}

The radiometry of each image used for ortho photo will finally be $O_i(x,y) P_i(x,y) R(x,y)$.
Of course for equation~\ref{Eq:Rad:PolIndiv} and~\ref{Eq:Rad:PolGlob}, there is
much more observations than unknowns and they are solved using least mean square.
User can control the radiometric equalization by specifying the
degree of the polynom. The syntax is:




\begin{verbatim}
Tawny -help
*****************************
*  Help for Elise Arg main  *
*****************************
Unnamed args :
  * string :: {Directory where are the datas}
Named args :
  * [Name=DEq] INT :: {Degree of equalization (Def=1)}
  * [Name=DEq] INT :: {Degree of equalization (Def=1)}
  * [Name=DEqXY] Pt2di :: {Degree of equalization, if diff in X and Y}
  * [Name=AddCste] bool :: {Add unknown constant for equalization (Def=false)}
  * [Name=DegRap] INT :: {Degree of rappel to initial values, Def = 0}
  * [Name=DegRapXY] Pt2di :: {Degree of rappel to initial values, Def = 0}
  * [Name=RGP] bool :: {Rappel glob on physically equalized, Def = true}
  * [Name=DynG] REAL :: {Global Dynamic (to correct saturation problems)}
  * [Name=ImPrio] string :: {Pattern of image with high prio, def=.*}

  * [Name=CorThr] REAL :: {Threshold of correlation to validate homologous}
  * [Name=NbPerIm] REAL :: {Average number of point per image}
\end{verbatim}

The only mandatory argument is the directory where the
elementary ortho images have been created by {\tt Malt}. Parameters
{\tt DEq, DEqXY, AddCste, DegRap, DegRapXY} are relative to the correction
function used in radiometric equalization process:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt DEq} specifies the degree of polynoms $O_i$, the default value is
	$1$ , which means that for each ortho image, $A_i,B_i,C_i$ are computed
	to satisfy according to least mean square the equation~\ref{Eq:Rad:Mon};

   \item {\tt DEqXY} specifies the case where the degree of $O_i$ are different in
	 $x$ and $y$, if  {\tt DEqXY=[$D_X$,$D_Y$]}, the unknown monoms will
	 be $x^n,y^m$ such that $n\leq D_X$ , $m\leq D_Y$ ,   $n+m\leq Max(D_X,D_Y)$;

   \item {\tt AddCste} in this case an unknown constant $K_i$ is add to each ortho $O_i$ and
	  the equation ~\ref{Eq:Rad:PolIndiv} is replaced by ~\ref{Eq:Rad:PolIndivCste};
	  in almost every case, it is preferable to let the default value {\tt AddCste=false};

   \item {\tt DegRap} fix the degree of global polynom $R$;

   \item {\tt DegRapXY} fix the degree of global polynom $R$ when different in $x$ and $y$;

\end{itemize}



\begin{equation}
O_i(x,y)(A_i+B_ix+C_iy)=O_j(x,y)(A_j+B_jx+C_jy);
\label{Eq:Rad:Mon}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
   O_i(x,y) P_i(x,y) + K_i = O_j(x,y) P_j(x,y) + K_j
\label{Eq:Rad:PolIndivCste}
\end{equation}

Table~\ref{Tab:Ortho:Polyn} illustrates the influence of this parameter:

\begin{itemize}
   \item first line, with the minimum degree parameter, {\tt DEq=0 DegRap=0} some
	 frontier are visible;
   \item second line, with the default parameter, {\tt DEq=1 DegRap=0}, the frontier
	 are almost not visible but there is clearly a drift in radiometry;
   \item third line line, with  degree $1$ polynom per image and a degree $2$ global
	 attachment, the frontier are almost not visible and the drift has decreased:
   \item third line line, with  degree $1$ polynom per image and a degree $4$, the
	 has disappeared except at points close to the border;
\end{itemize}

Note however that this data-set is surprisingly difficult to equalize for such a
small set. With many data sets, the default parameters already give an acceptable result.

The parameters {\tt SzV, CorThr, NbPerIm} are relative to the choice of the point
used for the radiometric equalization:


\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt SzV} is the size of the patch used for each sample of the radiometric equalization,
	 this patches will be used for computing an average value and for correlation  \dots

   \item  \dots on each patch, correlation coefficient  $C{i,j}$ are computed between pair
	  of images, they are used only if  $C{i,j} > CorThr$ ;

   \item {\tt NbPerIm} indicates the number of sample that will be approximately used on each image;

\end{itemize}


On many data sets default values should be OK. However it happened with difficult data
sets that all the measures were refused for some images pair, which obviously led to an error.
Here is an example of the command I used on a data set with such difficulties:


\begin{verbatim}
Tawny Ortho-MEC-Malt/ DEq=1 DegRap=1 ImPrio=Ort_IMG_.* SzV=3 CorThr=0.6 NbPerIm=5e4
\end{verbatim}
